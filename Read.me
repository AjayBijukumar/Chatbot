Developed a conversational AI chatbot using OpenAI’s API to identify and correct misinformation in the medical field. The system analyzes user-submitted health claims and verifies their authenticity by cross-referencing verified facts from official healthcare sources like WHO, CDC, and PubMed. Integrated a custom PDF dataset containing validated information on common diseases prone to misinformation, including COVID-19, Measles, Influenza, and HPV, enhancing the chatbot’s reliability in real-time health query responses.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Flask (or Streamlit, if applicable), OpenAI API, PDF data extraction, Microsoft Word, AI prompt engineering.
